R code and data files related to Boyajians Star
This is what I have been using to plot and analyze publically avaiable data about Boyajians Star. See the reddit wiki at
https://www.reddit.com/r/KIC8462852/wiki/index for more information about the star. 
Most of the data is downloaded from aavso.org
The plotting scripts run by sourcing input files in the "input_files" directory. 
The primary AAVSO data plotting script is plot_aavso_binned.R
If you find any  issues with these scripts feel free to write them up on here.
